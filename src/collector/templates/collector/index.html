<strong>CORRIDORS OF TIME<br />
CROWDSOURCED TRANSCRIPTION & VALIDATION<br />
<p>
We cache almost everything for 5 mins, now that @Skrillex got our main DB query sane.</strong>
<h4>Purpose:</h4>
The purpose of this site is to provide the most accurate database of puzzle piece transcriptions by crowdsourcing the transcription process and verifying through redundancy.<br />
<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br />
Because we wanted this in front of people NAOW, the frontend is extremely dirty. We are working with someone to fix that. In the meantime, this is what it is.<br />
<h4>Help wanted:</h4>
Transcriptions needed! Read the <a href="{% url 'transcriptionGuide' %}">Guide</a>, then <a href="{% url 'transcribe' %}">Start Transcibing</a>!<br />
<h4>Access to data:</h4>
There would be no point to this effort at all if you didn't get the output. All our data is yours in .csv format. Slice dice and combine with other data sources any way, and get that puzzle solved!<br />
We update the .csv every 15 minutes right now to have semi-sane server loads.
<h4>How this works:</h4>
Each image is transcribed several times by different people. Identical transcriptions increases the confidence that the transcription is accurate. Once the accuracy of an image's transcription has reached a high confidence rating, it will be added to our table of verified results.
